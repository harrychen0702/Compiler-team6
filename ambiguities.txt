//*This document is used to show and explain ambiguities that present in the specification.*/

Paragraph: 3
Problem: It is not clear whether we can write “#/“ as a comment, like “/# #/ #/”.
Our solution: This is not possible in many other languages, so our compiler does not accept this syntax.

Paragraph: 8
Problem: The spec has a assignment that used “{1:T}” as a pair in the dictionary: “dict<int, top> := {1:1, … , {1:T}}”. 
Our solution: In the case of {1:T}, we think it is a mistake and our compiler does not accept this syntax.

Paragraph: 9
Problem: The spec has a assignment that written as: “s:seq<top> s := […];”. It is not clear that what is the purpose of the second “s”.
Our solution: We think it is a mistake and our compiler does not accept this syntax.

Paragraph: 10
Problem: The spec has not give us a definition of “String”, so our compiler cannot recognize   “seq<char> := “hello world””.
Our solution: We think it is a mistake, so we declare “String“ in the lexer.

Paragraph: 11
Problem: It is not clear whether we can write “[:]” as sequence slicing.
Our solution: This is possible in many other languages like python, so our compiler accept this syntax.

Paragraph: 11
Problem: It is not clear whether we can write s[-3] when s is a sequence that shorter than 3.
Our solution: This is not possible in many other languages, so our compiler does not accept this syntax.

Paragraph: 12
Problem: It is not clear whether we can connect two sequences that have different type.
Our solution: ****************************

Paragraph: 13
Problem: It is not clear that what is the type of parameters in the “alias”. The spec gives two examples: “alias old_name new_name” and “alias seq<char> string”, and it is not clear about the type of these parameters.
Our solution: **********************************

Paragraph: 15
Problem: The use of foo() is undefined.
Our solution: *******************************

Paragraph: 17
Problem: The spec gives a example: “g: int := ?pred?foo();”. If the red evaluates to F, g will be assigned null.
Our solution:***********************************

Paragraph: 18
Problem: It is not clear about the path declaration of the standard input.
Our solution:**********************************

Paragraph: 18
Problem: Calling a function whose predicate evaluates to F equals NOP.

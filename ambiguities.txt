Paragraph: 72Problem: it is not clear whether we can omit both the start and end indices         in sequence slicing, like "foo = bar[:]".Our solution: this is possible in many other languages that support list              slicing (like Python), so our compiler accepts this syntax.Paragraph: 99Problem: the spec has an assignment using the equality operator,        "foo == bar;".Our solution: we think this is a mistake, and our compiler does not accept            this statement.
